Graph Applications

Algorithms that use depth-first search as a building block include:

    1. Finding connected components.
    2. Topological sorting.
    3. Finding the bridges of a graph.
    4. Generating words in order to plot the limit set of a group.
    5. Finding strongly connected components.
    6. Planarity testing
    7. Solving puzzles with only one solution, such as mazes. (DFS can be adapted to find all solutions to a maze by only including nodes on the current path in the visited set.)
    8. Maze generation may use a randomized depth-first search.
    9. Finding biconnectivity in graphs.
    
 Breadth-first search can be used to solve many problems in graph theory, for example:

    1. Copying garbage collection, Cheney's algorithm
    2. Finding the shortest path between two nodes u and v, with path length measured by number of edges (an advantage over depth-first search)[10]
    (Reverse) Cuthill–McKee mesh numbering
    3. Ford–Fulkerson method for computing the maximum flow in a flow network
    4. Serialization/Deserialization of a binary tree vs serialization in sorted order, allows the tree to be re-constructed in an efficient manner.
    5. Construction of the failure function of the Aho-Corasick pattern matcher.
    6. Testing bipartiteness of a graph.
    
  Other Applications 
   1. To find a shortest path between source and destinations 
   2. Minimum spanning tree
   3. To solve salesman problem
   4. Topological sorting
